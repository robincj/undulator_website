<p>Race officials will be at the edge of Lake Oneke (which is the new
	finish of Day 1) from 12- 6pm.</p>
<p>Our vans will be dropping you at either Pinnacles Camp Site or
	accommodation that you have organised between Pinnacles and Mangatoetoe
	Valley. Your accommodation needs to be along this road unless you
	arrange your own transport.</p>
<p>WE WILL SUPPLY DETAILED MAPS WITH COMMENTS. YOU WILL STILL NEED YOUR
	OWN TOPO MAPS THOUGH.</p>

<h4>Route</h4>
<h5>PLEASE NOTE THAT AS OF 2020 THE DAY 1 COURSE HAS CHANGED FROM
	PREVIOUS YEARS</h5>
<p>Run around the coast until about 1km before the lighthouse. There is
	a small track that climbs up the hill to your left (this will be
	marked) . Take that and it will take you to a stile, hop over that and
	continue down the track to the lake.</p>

<a href="/images/maps/A100/A100_Day_1_east_harbour_map.jpg"
	target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive"
	src="/images/maps/A100/A100_Day_1_east_harbour_map.jpg" /></a>

<p>Unlike previous years, you must now turn RIGHT here and head towards
	the coast. Turn left when you reach the coast, cross the stream and
	take the next track on your left back up into the hills. At the top of
	this hill you should reach a farm track intersection, there should be a
	marshal here to guide you right and back down to the coast.</p>

<p>Once you hit coast run around coast track staying towards the coast
	the whole way. You will hit a small gate that says private. The owner
	does not mind if you run through. It's only about 1 km.</p>
<p>Then you hit the beach and the rocks (very large rocks about 5 metres
	high) you can run through these rocks by using a narrow corridor that
	is not immediately obvious until you approach them (this will be
	marked) onto the beach.</p>
<p>
	There will be a marshal here to direct you to follow the beach around
	the inlet. There may be a shallow inlet crossing if at all. <img
		src='/images/maps/A100/A100_Day_1_coast_photo.jpg' width='50%'
		style='float: left; margin: 1em;' />
</p>
<p>Run along the sand bypassing the Wainuiomata river that lagoons into
	an inlet. You can bypass this by running through the rocks and along
	the sand on the beach . Along the sand you will then head up to the
	paved road and run to the head of Orongaronga Valley by the road.</p>
<p>There will be a bridge where a marshal will be. This marshal at the
	head of the valley will take your name and send you up the main
	Orongorongo Valley.</p>
<p>You find your way up the valley for approx 10km until you will see
	another marshal. He will point you up towards the Mt Matthews track.</p>
<p>Take this track following markers until you hit the intersection that
	goes left (up to Mt Matthews ) or right (up to South Saddle) you need
	to take right up to South Saddle. Do NOT go up Mt Matthews.</p>
<p>Once you hit the South saddle you will see an iron pole at top (this
	will be marked with tape) . If you look down the other side (it is not
	immediately obvious) you will see a track that descends down a narrow
	gully with trees to MukaMuka Valley. It is well marked by DOC.</p>
<p>Keep following this gnarly track down to main valley and descend down
	to coast. At coast turn left and follow the 4wd or the beach to the
	finish flags at the edge of Lake Oneke.</p>
