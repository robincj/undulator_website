Start at Pinnacles car park (20 min down road from bach) and runs up the main river valley for a few minutes on left side of valley you will see a sign that says Pinnacles The High Way , take this route up to the main Aorangi Track. At the top you will turn left (right is towards Washpol where you have come from the day before!) then after a few minutes you will get to another intersection that says to Sunderlands Hut. Take this turn that descends to a river valley (stream) the 4 wd will cross the river and goes up other side. This is the start of a major undulation that will last for about 1- 1hr 30 min . Once you get to the tops it opens out and hopefully you will get some views. The only place you can get lost is the first major intersection that goes left or right. Take the right that descends this is the main ridge . the one that goes up and left is the wrong one and eventally drops to a major river valley DONT GO THAT WAY. After this its all undulating 4wd until you get to the big rocky descent to Sunderlands Hut valley. Once you get to bottom turn right and follow 4wd that keeps crossing river. It eventually gets to a last uphill.
 
At the top of this you have a final k descent then you will see Waikuku Lodge and finishing flags!
 
Transport is available to pick you up at end of day 3 and take you back to Wellington unless you want to stay the night at Waikuku Lodge at the end of the run and go back to welly Mon morning. More details to come...Of course your friends relatives can get involved too if they want re pick ups and drop offs but i will need to be very stringent with who is where at all times i need to know for safety...THIS IS V IMPT you let me know if someone else gives you a ride etc As we need to know who is on course and who isn't.
