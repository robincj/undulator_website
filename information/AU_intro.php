		The Aorangi Undulator is a 33km trail-running race which takes
		competitors through five valleys and four <i>undulations</i> among the
		mountains of the Aorangi Forest Park, situated in the south-east of
		the Wairarapa. The November 2014 Aorangi Undulator was the first
		official race and the 2015 event was even more popular.
		Winners are expected to finish in around 5 hours while others will
		take up to 10 hours.
