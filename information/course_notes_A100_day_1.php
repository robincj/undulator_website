<h3>Day 1</h3>

<p>Day 1 of the Aorangi Undulator 100 starts on Fri 6th November at 7am
	at the end of Muritai Road, at the gate where the where 4WD road
	starts. You will be running 50km which is expected to take competitors
	from 5 to 11 hours.</p>
<p>Note that this year the course is longer than last year (2014) as we
	will take you 6km past the location of last year's finish line, along
	4wd track to get to the ferry which will carry you across lake after
	you finish.</p>
<p>
	Last year's route can be viewed here on Mapmyrun: <a

</p>
<p>Race officials will be at the edge of Lake Oneke (which is the new
	finish of Day 1) from 12- 6pm.</p>
<p>This year there will be a boat that will take you across Lake Oneke
	to Lake Ferry pub where we are trying to arrange a shower and
	smorgasboard (discussions taking place). After this we will be dropping
	you at either Pinnacles Camp Site of a bach that you have organised
	between Pinnacles and Mangatoetoe Valley. Your accom needs to be along
	this road unless you arrange your own transport.</p>
<p>WE WILL SUPPLY DETAILED MAPS WITH COMMENTS. YOU WILL STILL NEED YOUR
	OWN TOPO MAPS THOUGH.</p>

<h4>Route</h4>
<p>Run around the coast until a k or 2 before the end (lighthouse) there
	is a small track that sidles up the hill to your left (this will be
	marked) . Take that and it will take you to a stall hop over that and
	continue down the track. Take the first left that takes you around the
	first East Harbour Lake.</p>

<p>Then once around that head down to the coast. The track branches left
	or right near the coast take either one they both about same time.</p>
<p>Once you hit coast run around coast track staying towards the coast
	the whole way. You will hit a small gate that says private. The owner
	does not mind if you run through. Its only about a k. Then you hit the
	beach and the rocks (very large rocks about 5 metres high) you can run
	through these rocks by using a narrow corridor that is not immediately
	obvious until you approach them (this will be marked this year) onto
	the beach .There will be a marshal here to direct you as last year
	people did not take the beach route and they ned to follow the beach
	around the inlet. There may be a shallow inlet crossing if at all.</p>
<p>Run along the sand bypassing the Wainuiomata river that lagoons into
	an inlet. You can bypass this by running through the rocks and along
	the sand on the beach . Along the sane you will then head up to the
	paved road and run to the head of Orongaronga Valley by the road.</p>
<p>There will be a bridge where a marshal will be. This marshal at the
	head of the valley and take your name and send you up the main
	Orongaronga Valley. You find your way up the valley for approx 10k
	until you will see another marshal. He will point you up towards the Mt
	Mathews track. Take this track following markers until you hit the
	intersection that goes left (up to mt Mathews ) or right (up to South
	Saddle) you need to take right up to Sth Saddle. Do NOT go up Mt
	Mathews. Once you hit the South saddle you will see an iron pole at top
	(this will be marked with tape this year) . If you look down the other
	side (it is not immediately obvious) you will see a track that descends
	down a narrow gully with trees to MukuMuku Valley. It is well marked by
	DOC. Keep following this gnarly track down to main valley and descend
	down to coast. At coast turn left and follow the 4wd or the beach to
	the finish flags at the edge of Lake Oneke. A boat will come
	periodically to take the runers across to Lake Ferry pub.</p>
