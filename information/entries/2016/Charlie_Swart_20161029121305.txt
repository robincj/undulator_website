previous_events: this will be my first race of this type.  I have done some of the great walks (abel tasman, tongariro), and some local tramps in Tararua's.  I am currently training for the half iron man in Taupo in Dec.  I heard about the race through my friend Jimmie Fourie who has registered for the 100km.  My plan is to pair up with him for the undulator.
