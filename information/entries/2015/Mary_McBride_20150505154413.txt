previous_events: I think you know my credentials.  However, this weekend just finished, I ran the Milford on Saturday (61km including Mt Hart ascent) The Routeburn on Sunday (35km including Conical Hill ascent) and McIntosh Track (20km including 1300m of ascent).  It was excellent.  I know I am on the waiting list but hopefully someone will get sick or injured to my benefit :)
