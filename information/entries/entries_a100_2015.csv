Gareth Thomas,,open,y," just finished the Tarawera 100km in Feb (just under 14 hours), completed the 70km same event last year 9.5 hours, ran Wellington marathon in 3:18 last year. Also ran the Mukamuka Munter the year before in 4 hours. I'm running with Mal for his High 5-0 with Clive Start (I asked him last night if he was running the Aorangi this year, but apparently it's the same weekend as his wifes birthday so he unfortunately had to decline) and a few others next Friday, and also doing the Great forest marathon in April up near Levin.  Attempted TNF 100 in 2012 but pulled due to injury, also done Melbourne Marathon (3:25), plus numerous halves/30km etc.  "

Viktor Safar,safar.viktor@gmail.com,open,y,"Well, the Undulator last year was the most difficult race I've ever done but I'd done several adventure runs back in Europe before coming here.  Never done back to back long runs.  As I said, the next 6 months is going to be hard. But, hey, that's why we do this :)"

However, this weekend just finished, I ran the Milford on Saturday (61km including Mt Hart ascent) The Routeburn on Sunday (35km including Conical Hill ascent) and McIntosh Track (20km including 1300m of ascent).  It was excellent.  I know I am on the waiting list but hopefully someone will get sick or injured to my benefit :)",W
