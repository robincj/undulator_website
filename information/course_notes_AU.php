	Day 2 <small>(also A.U. 1-day event)</small>
</h3>
<p class="A100">
	You will be starting your second day with the 1-day event competitors.<br />
	There is a camp site at the Pinnacles, if you camp there then at 5am on
	Saturday you can be transported in the support van to the Day 2 start.<br />
	Day 2 finishes in the Putangirua Pinnacles car park. Transport is
	available to pick you up from the finish and take you back to your
	accommodation.<br />

</p>
<p>The fastest times over this course are expected to be expected around
	5-6 hours, and the slowest 10-12 hours.</p>
<p>The whole course is a marked DOC route, covered the whole way by
	triangular orange DOC markers and backed up in the less obvious places
	(such as tree falls / junctions) by orange tape markings.
<ul>
	<li>IF YOU ARE IN THE BUSH AND HAVE NOT SEEN AN ORANGE MARKER IN A
		WHILE YOU ARE OFF THE TRACK. Retrace steps to last known point, DON’T
		JUST BLUNDER ONWARDS.
	
	<li>Orange markers are less frequent in the river valleys.
	
	<li>See more specific notes below, but significant aspects of the route
		simply follow the river’s route - so do the same but LOOK REGULARLY
		for orange markers which signify deviations from the river / creek.
	
	<li>Oh, and there’re lots of nettles, gorse, rocks and roots, which are
		not suitable for the weak.

<h2>Detailed Route Notes</h2>
<h3>START</h3>
Start at Mangatoetoe river end to Kawakawa Hut. Follow river upstream.
<br />
After 4km (30 mins ish) the river splits around an island before
rejoining further upstream. Take the left (true right) side.
<br />
Another 1km (10mins ish) there’s a river junction on the right (true
left). Take left river (true right) and aim for the large orange DOC
triangle.
<br />
Travel now up river, dipping in out, it is gorge like. Follow regular
DOC orange marks where possible.
<br />
Exit fork from river well marked by cut cabbage tree stump in river.


<h3>UNDULATION #1</h3>
Approx. 130m vertical climb. Steep climb, sidle over saddle, then very
steep descent, TAKE CARE. Descent ends by waterfall and pool – follow
river down stream, rocky boulder hopping for 4km.
<br />
At that 4km point make sure you scanning the right of river as there
will be abig DOC triangle marking where you leave the river bed. You
must spot this or you will miss the turn off and head down the river.
The triangle leads you into acopse of trees and a track that leads to
<b>Kawakawa Hut</b>
.

<h3>KAWAKAWA HUT</h3>
Kawakawa Hut is on true right of river, and marshalled. A 4WD track
crosses river at hut. You MUST GET CHECKED BY MARSHAL at the hut.
<br />
Kawakawa hut to Pararaki HutHead upstream crossing creek regularly for
10 to 15 mins. Turn left at ‘Pararaki Hut’ wooden sign.


<h3>UNDULATION #2</h3>
Approx. 310m vertical climb. Steep climb up narrow ridge – careful,
don’t fall off. Long cambered sidle to saddle.
<br />
When you hit the BIG fallen log look hard left for the track not
straight ahead.
<br />
After saddle descend to Pararaki river.
<br />
Turn right upstream at river.

<h3>PARARAKI HUT</h3>
<b>Pararaki hut</b>
is 100m upstream on left (true right).
<br />
YOU MUST GET CHECKED BY MARSHAL at the hut. Pararaki hut to Washpool hut


<h3>UNDULATION #3</h3>
Approx. 550m vertical climb. Windfall at base of track not far from hut,
follow orange taps and markers. Solid climb, obvious track.
<br />
Then very steep descent ending in a final 30 or so metres of loose
scree, very easy to gather unwanted / wanted momentum.
<br />
Turn left at Washpool stream and follow blazes downstream for 100m, look
for sign to hut on true right bank and head up steps to
<b>Washpool hut</b>
.


<h3>WASHPOOL HUT</h3>
YOU MUST GET CHECKED BY MARSHAL at the Washpool hut.
<br />
Washpool hut to Finish: Follow well signed Kopi track, up, up and up.


<h3>UNDULATION #4</h3>
Approx. 550m vertical climb. Steep climb, summit and obvious left
towards NW ridge.
<br />
Ridge undulates for 3km through bush. When you get to old fence and 4x4
track it is pretty much the climbing over.
<br />
Descend through ‘Gorse Alley’ – like taking off a plaster this is best
done quickly, showing weakness will be booed.
<br />
Take signed (and marshalled) left turn to Pinnacles – YOU MUST CHECK IN
WITH MARSHAL.
<br />
Turn left to lookout track NOT ‘Circular Walk’ and descend obvious
stepped route to river valley.
<br />
Turn right at river valley and follow river downstream towards aromas of
sausages sizzling and rest awaiting.
<br />
Look out for BLUE WARATAHS WITH ORANGE TRIANGLES. There are 2 and will
put you on the track to the finish. If you miss them it’s not a major
you’ll just be running on rougher terrain and it will take longer.
<br />
You’re done.

<h3>Go party. You are not weak.</h3>
