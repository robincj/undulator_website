			<h3>Complete Energy and Electrolytes</h3>
			<div style="font-family: jockey one, sans-serif;">
				<p>Tailwind’s potent energy and electrolytes are all you need to go
					all day. No juggling gels, pills, or chews; just pour, shake, and
					go. Most drinks require you to supplement calories and don’t
					contain anywhere near the electrolytes needed to replace what you
					sweat out.
				
				
				<p>Tailwind’s fuel can meet your complete calorie needs, and sipping
					it regularly gives you steady energy all day. Tailwind also has a
					full complement of electrolytes that mimic the composition and
					proportions of sweat, so you don't have to take separate
					electrolyte pills to make up for what's not in your drink.

					<p>"I’ve used a wide variety of nutritional products to get though
						multisport events and 100km ultra trail runs. Tailwind is only
						product that I’ve been 100% happy with. I never feel hungry during
						the runs and don’t have any monster pains or stomach cramps after
						I’m done. It’s easy to mix up, light to carry spare and best of
						all you never feel flat. Leaving you to concentrating on racing
						(or the scenery)."
