GPX files for GPS devices
If you have a GPS device (Garmin running watch or similar), then it is recommended that you
upload the course directions to it and use it during the event.
 
You can download .gpx files for use on your GPS device. Clicking on the file names
on the right will download them to your computer. You can then use your GPS device's software
to upload the course to the device. Several websites also support this functionality e.g. Garmin
Connect, MapMyRun etc.
